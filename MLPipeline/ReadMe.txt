This Python script, AdvancedMLPipeline.py, demonstrates an advanced machine learning pipeline. It includes feature engineering to enhance the dataset, PCA for dimensionality reduction, dynamic feature selection with SelectFromModel, and model optimization through GridSearchCV. The pipeline employs a RandomForestClassifier and provides a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.
